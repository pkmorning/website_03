abstract: The relevance of macroalgae as alternative and anti-methanogenic ruminant feeds depends upon their nutritional contents, digestibility, CH4 mitigating potential, and influences on animal and environmental health. Red macroalgae such as A. taxiformis and A. armata seem to be promising anti-methanogenic feed ingredients and do not lead to significant adverse impacts on feed degradability with an inclusion rate of under 5% of OM. However, the impacts on other parameters of animal performances (e.g. feed intake, weight gain and milk yield) and rumen fermentation products, such as total VFA, should be carefully monitored. Moreover, due to a high concentration of halogenated compounds (e.g. bromoform) in those species, their potential adverse effects on human and environmental health must also be assessed. Brown macroalgae, such as D. bartayresii, C. trinodis and A. nodosum, can be effective anti-methanogenic feed ingredients. Nevertheless, a high phlorotannin and polysaccharide content of these species can negatively impact the rumen degradability at high inclusion levels and thus optimal supplementation levels of these algae need to be carefully maintained. Green algae, including C. patentiramea, can also mitigate enteric CH4 production, but the active anti-methanogenic compounds in green macroalgae are unknown.Red macroalgae, such as P. palmata, Porphyra spp. and Gracilaria spp., and the green species Acrosiphonia, C. rupestris, Ruppia and Ulva can be used as a nutrient source due to their better nutritional composition and greater degradability compared to other species. Among brown macroalgae, A. esculenta, Laminaria spp., S. latissima and U. pinnatifida could be used as feed additives in up to 10–25% of DM in the ruminant feed provided that the excess mineral content is removed. Overall, macroalgal species could be an important component of future ruminant feed, but further in vivo studies are required to identify any potential adverse impacts on animal health and performance.
