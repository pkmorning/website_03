abstract: The aim was to test the hypothesis that prenatal under- and overnutrition in late ges-tation can program small intestinal (SI) growth, angiogenesis, and endocrine func-tion to predispose for a hyperabsorptive state, thereby increasing the susceptibility to the adverse effects of an early postnatal obesogenic diet. Twin-pregnant ewes were exposed to adequate (NORM), LOW (50% of NORM), or HIGH (150% energy and 110%  protein  of  NORM)  diets  through  the  last  trimester  (term  ~147  days).  From  3  days  to  6  months  of  age,  their  lambs  were  fed  either  a  moderate  (CONV)  or  a  high-carbohydrate  high-fat  (HCHF)  diet.  At  6  months  of  age,  responses  in  plasma  metabolites and insulin to refeeding after fasting were determined and then different segments  of  the  SI  were  sampled  at  autopsy.  Prenatal  overnutrition  impacts  were  most abundant in the duodenum where HIGH had increased villus amplification fac-tor and lowered villi thickness with increased IRS-1 and reduced GH-R expressions. In jejunum, HIGH lambs had an increased expression of Lactate gene and amplified when exposed to HCHF postnatally. Specifically, in LOW, sensitivity to HCHF was affected  in  ileum.  Thus,  the  mismatching  LOW-HCHF  nutrition  increased  expres-sions of angiogenic genes (VEGF, VEGF-R1, ANGPT1, RTK) and increased mucosa layer (tunica mucosa) thickness but reduced muscle layer (Tunica muscularis) thick-ness.  The  SI  is  a  target  of  prenatal  nutritional  programming,  where  late  gestation  overnutrition increased and shifted digestive capacity for carbohydrates toward the jejunum, whereas late gestation undernutrition predisposed for ileal angiogenesis and carbohydrate and fat hyperabsorptive capacity upon subsequent exposure to postna-tal obesogenic diet.
