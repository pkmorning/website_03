abstract: The global epidemic of obesity and associated metabolic disorders continue to develop, affecting quality of life in developed as well as developing countries. Traditionally, intake of unhealthy diets and lack of physical activity in postnatal life were considered to be the major risk factors for development of visceral obesity and metabolic diseases. Recent studies have pointed out that malnutrition also prior to birth plays a vital role in the predisposition for visceral obesity and metabolic disorders. In this review, we highlight how maternal undernutrition during critical periods of foetal development affects traits associated with development of visceral obesity later in life. Prenatal undernutrition particularly during the later stages of gestation can induce differential signals in adipose tissue in such a way that lipid storing capacity and hence expandability of subcutaneous fat are compromised leading to marked overexpansion (adipocyte hypertrophy) of visceral adipose tissues, in sheep particularly in perirenal fat. Such changes in adiposity can result in elevated inflammatory responses and associated metabolic disturbances. Foetal undernutrition is associated with epigenetic changes resulting in altered expression of key genes, which potentially can be involved in this development of visceral obesity, but the detailed mechanisms are not yet well known. Proper nutrition during critical periods of foetal development is thus important to counteract the increased trend of visceral obesity and associated disorders in humans, and a healthy diet postnatally appears particular important for individuals exposed to undernutrition prenatally.
