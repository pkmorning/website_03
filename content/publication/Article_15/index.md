abstract: Nepal and many developing countries are currently suffering from increased prevalence of obesity, type 2 di- abetes, and other metabolic disorders. Unhealthy dietary habits and physical inactivity are traditionally considered as re- sponsible factors for these disorders. The relatively new concept of foetal programming suggests that development of met- abolic diseases later in life may be associated with poor nutritional status in utero, and such phenomenon could be ampli- fied by subsequent exposure to unhealthy diets after birth. We suggest that foetal programming and mismatched nutri- tional situations during foetal and postnatal life are important causative factors for increased prevalence of obesity and metabolic disorders in Nepal. Issues highlighted in this paper may also be relevant to other developing countries with similar socioeconomic status. Undernutrition in foetal life can predispose for visceral fat deposition and may alter dietary preferences towards unhealthy diets, amplifying the risk of nutritional mismatch after birth; this can lead to metabolic disturbances in a number of pathways including glucose and lipid metabolism. Providing attention to early life nutrition could therefore be an important tool to reduce the prevalence of lifestyle diseases in Nepal. Future national health policies should thus include changes in research and intervention activities towards preventing averse early life nutritional pro- gramming. Availability of free-of-cost and mandatory nutritional education and medical services to pregnant women and their families and better management of national health care systems including digitalization of national health data could be viable strategies to achieve these goals.
