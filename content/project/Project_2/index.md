summary: The development of a sustainable livestock production sector is essential to feed the rising human population while maintaining environmental health. In collaboration with industry partners, this project aims to evaluate nutritive values, digestibility characteristics, and potential anti-methanogenic properties of different types and species of seaweeds available in central Norway. Thus, this project will contribute towards the commercialization of currently seaweed-based biomass for animal feeding. This project is funded by the Regional research fund (RFF Midt-Norge).
