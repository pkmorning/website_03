summary: The overall goal of this project is to assess whether insect larvae, raised under locally available agricultural by-products, could be a domestic and sustainable source of protein in the future to improve the protein self-sufficiency of the Norwegian livestock sector. This project is supported by the Regional Research Fund (RFF-Tr√∏ndelag).
