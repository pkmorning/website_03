summary: In this project, various brown seaweeds will be tested based on their potential anti-microbial properties in response to harvesting time and pre-treatments. This information helps to identify potential brown seaweed species of desirable anti-microbial characteristics. Thus, this project contributes towards the possible utilization of brown seaweeds as beneficial feed additives for farm animals in the future. This project is supported by the Regional Research Fund (RFF-Tr√∏ndelag).
