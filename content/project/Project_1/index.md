summary: Increased concerns on global population rise and higher competition between humans and animals for foods have urged use to identify alternative feeding materials for animals to establish a sustainable and more profitable livestock sector in the future. As seaweeds are an integral component of the Norwegian coastal ecosystems, this project will evaluate the impacts of seaweed-based diets on growth characteristics, health status and metabolic and endocrine function, and farm animals' overall production potential. Such information should help us assess whether seaweeds will serve as reliable feeding material for livestock production in the future. This project is funded by the Faculty of Bioscience and Aquaculture (FBA), Nord University, Norway.
