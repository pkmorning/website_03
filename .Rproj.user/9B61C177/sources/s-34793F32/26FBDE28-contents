summary: This project aims to validate the recently installed Controlling and Recording Feed Intake (CRFI) system and integrate this with existing automated livestock management tools, such as Robot Milking System. The system will evaluate the impacts of various feeding materials on animal performance (feed intake, production) and welfare status in ruminants. This project is supported by the Regional Research Fund (RFF-Tr√∏ndelag).
