Twin‐lambs born to dams fed HIGH (150%/110% of required energy/protein, respectively), NORM (100% of requirements) or LOW (50% of NORM) diets during the last trimester were used. Postnatally, lambs were raised on moderate (CONV) or high‐carbohydrate‐high‐fat (HCHF) diets. Adipose tissues were sampled at autopsy at 6 months of age (~puberty) to characterize cellularity, adipocyte cross‐sectional area and gene expression patterns. HIGH and LOW compared to NORM lambs had reduced intrinsic (under CONV diet) cellularity in subcutaneous and mesenteric (particularly LOW), and reduced obesity‐induced (under HCHF diet) hyperplasia in subcutaneous, mesenteric and perirenal (particularly HIGH) adipose tissues. This corresponded with more pronounced HCHF diet‐induced hypertrophy in mesenteric (particularly LOW), perirenal (particularly HIGH) and subcutaneous (particularly HIGH) adipose tissues, and tissue‐specific reductions in mRNA expressions for lipid metabolism, angiogenesis and adipose development. Gene expression for inflammation and lipid metabolism markers were increased and decreased, respectively, in HCHF lambs (HCHF lambs became obese) in all tissues. Both prenatal over‐ and undernutrition predisposed for abdominal adiposity and extreme perirenal hypertrophy due to reduced intrinsic (observed under CONV diet) cellularity and impaired ability of subcutaneous, mesenteric and perirenal adipose tissues to expand by hyperplasia rather than hypertrophy on an obesogenic (HCHF) diet.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Differential impacts of late gestational over–and undernutrition on adipose tissue traits and associated visceral obesity risk upon exposure to a postnatal high‐fat diet in adolescent sheep","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prabhat Khanal","Anne Marie D.

Twin-pregnant ewes were exposed to adequate (NORM), LOW (50% of NORM), or HIGH (150% energy and 110%  protein  of  NORM)  diets  through  the  last  trimester  (term  ~147  days).  From  3  days  to  6  months  of  age,  their  lambs  were  fed  either  a  moderate  (CONV)  or  a  high-carbohydrate  high-fat  (HCHF)  diet.  At  6  months  of  age,  responses  in  plasma  metabolites and insulin to refeeding after fasting were determined and then different segments  of  the  SI  were  sampled  at  autopsy.  Prenatal  overnutrition  impacts  were  most abundant in the duodenum where HIGH had increased villus amplification fac-tor and lowered villi thickness with increased IRS-1 and reduced GH-R expressions. In jejunum, HIGH lambs had an increased expression of Lactate gene and amplified when exposed to HCHF postnatally. Specifically, in LOW, sensitivity to HCHF was affected  in  ileum.  Thus,  the  mismatching  LOW-HCHF  nutrition  increased  expres-sions of angiogenic genes (VEGF, VEGF-R1, ANGPT1, RTK) and increased mucosa layer (tunica mucosa) thickness but reduced muscle layer (Tunica muscularis) thickness.  The  SI  is  a  target  of  prenatal  nutritional  programming,  where  late  gestation  overnutrition increased and shifted digestive capacity for carbohydrates toward the jejunum, whereas late gestation undernutrition predisposed for ileal angiogenesis and carbohydrate and fat hyperabsorptive capacity upon subsequent exposure to postnatal obesogenic diet.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Prenatal over- and undernutrition differentially program small intestinal growth, angiogenesis, absorptive capacity, and endocrine function in sheep","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"0793c4d52a42c311152acdd6cf592fca","permalink":"/project/project_4/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/project_4/","section":"project","summary":"In this project, various brown seaweeds will be tested based on their potential anti-microbial properties in response to harvesting time and pre-treatments.

Unhealthy dietary habits and physical inactivity are traditionally considered as re- sponsible factors for these disorders. The relatively new concept of foetal programming suggests that development of met- abolic diseases later in life may be associated with poor nutritional status in utero, and such phenomenon could be ampli- fied by subsequent exposure to unhealthy diets after birth. We suggest that foetal programming and mismatched nutri- tional situations during foetal and postnatal life are important causative factors for increased prevalence of obesity and metabolic disorders in Nepal. Issues highlighted in this paper may also be relevant to other developing countries with similar socioeconomic status. Undernutrition in foetal life can predispose for visceral fat deposition and may alter dietary preferences towards unhealthy diets, amplifying the risk of nutritional mismatch after birth; this can lead to metabolic disturbances in a number of pathways including glucose and lipid metabolism. Providing attention to early life nutrition could therefore be an important tool to reduce the prevalence of lifestyle diseases in Nepal. Future national health policies should thus include changes in research and intervention activities towards preventing averse early life nutritional pro- gramming.

Since the proposal of this phenomenon, it has been evaluated in various animal models to gain further insights into the mechanisms underlying the foetal origins of health and disease in humans. In FP research, the sheep has been quite extensively used as a model for humans. In this paper we will review findings mainly from our Copenhagen sheep model, on the implications of late gestation malnutrition for growth, development, and metabolic and endocrine functions later in life, and discuss how these implications may depend on the diet fed to the animal in early postnatal life. Our results have indicated that negative implications of foetal malnutrition, both as a result of overnutrition and, particularly, late gestation undernutrition, can impair a wide range of endocrine functions regulating growth and presumably also reproductive traits. These implications are not readily observable early in postnatal life, but are increasingly manifested as the animal approaches adulthood. No intervention or cure is known that can reverse this programming in postnatal life. Our findings suggest that close to normal growth and slaughter results can be obtained at least until puberty in animals which have undergone adverse programming in foetal life, but manifestation of programming effects becomes increasingly evident in adult animals. Due to the risk of transfer of the adverse programming effects to future generations, it is therefore recommended that animals that are suspected to have undergone adverse FP are not used for reproduction. Unfortunately, no reliable biomarkers have as yet been identified that allow accurate identification of adversely programmed offspring at birth, except for very low or high birth weights, and, in pigs, characteristic changes in head shape (dolphin head). Future efforts should be therefore dedicated to identify reliable biomarkers and evaluate their effectiveness for alleviation/reversal of the adverse programming in postnatal life. Our sheep studies have shown that the adverse impacts of an extreme, high-fat diet in early postnatal life, but not prenatal undernutrition, can be largely reversed by dietary correction later in life. Thus, birth (at term) appears to be a critical set point for permanent programming in animals born precocial, such as sheep. Appropriate attention to the nutrition of the late pregnant dam should therefore be a priority in animal production systems.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Impacts of prenatal nutrition on animal production and performance, a focus on growth and metabolic and endocrine function in sheep","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prabhat Khanal","Mette Olaf Nielsen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"6569ec291d9385adee44e341478dfb02","permalink":"/publication/article_9/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/article_9/","section":"publication","summary":"The global epidemic of obesity and associated metabolic disorders continue to develop, affecting quality of life in developed as well as developing countries. Traditionally, intake of unhealthy diets and lack of physical activity in postnatal life were considered to be the major risk factors for development of visceral obesity and metabolic diseases. Recent studies have pointed out that malnutrition also prior to birth plays a vital role in the predisposition for visceral obesity and metabolic disorders. In this review, we highlight how maternal undernutrition during critical periods of foetal development affects traits associated with development of visceral obesity later in life. Prenatal undernutrition particularly during the later stages of gestation can induce differential signals in adipose tissue in such a way that lipid storing capacity and hence expandability of subcutaneous fat are compromised leading to marked overexpansion (adipocyte hypertrophy) of visceral adipose tissues, in sheep particularly in perirenal fat. Such changes in adiposity can result in elevated inflammatory responses and associated metabolic disturbances. Foetal undernutrition is associated with epigenetic changes resulting in altered expression of key genes, which potentially can be involved in this development of visceral obesity, but the detailed mechanisms are not yet well known. Proper nutrition during critical periods of foetal development is thus important to counteract the increased trend of visceral obesity and associated disorders in humans, and a healthy diet postnatally appears particular important for individuals exposed to undernutrition prenatally.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Maternal undernutrition and visceral adiposity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

In this study, we aimed to test the hypotheses that late-gestation undernutrition 1) has long-term differential impacts on development, expandability and metabolic features in subcutaneous as compared to perirenal and mesenteric adipose tissues, which 2) will predispose for visceral obesity upon exposure to an obesogenic diet in early postnatal life. Twin-bearing last trimester ewes received diets supplying 100% (NORM) or 50% (LOW) of protein and energy requirements. Lambs received moderate, low-fat (CONV) or high-carbohydrate-high-fat (HCHF) diets from 3-days until 6-months of age (just after puberty), and then half the lambs (including all males) were sacrificed. Remaining animals (exclusively females) received a low-fat, grass-based diet until sacrificed at 2-years of age (adulthood).

Twin-pregnant ewes were fed NORM (100% of daily energy and protein requirements), LOW (50% of NORM) or HIGH (150%/110% of energy/protein requirements) diets during the last trimester. Postnatally, twin-lambs received obesogenic (HCHF) or moderate (CONV) diets until 6 months of age, and a moderate (obesity correcting) diet thereafter. At 2½ years of age (adulthood), plasma metabolite profiles during fasting, glucose, insulin and propionate (in fed and fasted states) tolerance tests were examined. Organ weights were determined at autopsy. Early obesity development was associated with lack of expansion of perirenal, but not other adipose tissues from adolescence to adulthood, resulting in 10% unit increased proportion of mesenteric of intra-abdominal fat. Prenatal undernutrition had a similar but much less pronounced effect. Across tolerance tests, LOW-HCHF sheep had highest plasma levels of cholesterol, urea-nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate. Sex specific differences were observed, particularly with respect to fat deposition, but direction of responses to early nutrition impacts were similar. However, prenatal undernutrition induced greater metabolic alterations in adult females than males. Foetal undernutrition, but not overnutrition, predisposed for adult hypercholesterolaemia, hyperureaemia, hypercreatinaemia and hyperlactataemia, which became manifested only in combination with early obesity development. Perirenal expandability may play a special role in this context. Differential nutrition recommendations may be advisable for individuals with low versus high birth weights.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Long-Term Impacts of Foetal Malnutrition Followed by Early Postnatal Obesity on Fat Distribution Pattern and Metabolic Adaptability in Adult Sheep","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prabhat Khanal, PhD"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Create a free website with Academic using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio.

In a 3 × 2 factorial design, twin‐pregnant ewes were for the last 6 weeks of gestation (term = 147 days) assigned to HIGH (N = 13; 150 and 110% of energy and protein requirements, respectively), NORM (N = 9; 100% of requirements) or LOW (N = 14; 50% of requirements) diets. The twin offspring were raised on high‐carbohydrate–high‐fat (HCHF; N = 35) or conventional (CONV; N = 35) diets from 3 days to 6 months of age (around puberty). Then intravenous glucose (GTT; overnight fasted), insulin (ITT; fed) and propionate (gluconeogenetic precursor; PTT; both fed and fasted) tolerance tests were conducted to evaluate (hepatic) metabolic plasticity. Prenatal malnutrition differentially impacted adaptations of particularly plasma lactate followed by glucose, cholesterol and insulin. This was most clearly expressed during PTT in fasted lambs and much less during ITT and GTT. In fasted lambs, propionate induced more dramatic increases in lactate than glucose, and HIGH lambs became more hyperglycaemic, hyperlactataemic and secreted less insulin compared to the hypercholesterolaemic LOW lambs. Propionate‐induced insulin secretion was virtually abolished in fasted HCHF lambs, but upregulated in fasted compared to fed CONV lambs. HCHF lambs had the greatest glucose‐induced insulin secretory responses. Prenatal malnutrition differentially programmed glucose–lactate metabolic pathways and cholesterol homeostasis. Prenatal overnutrition predisposed for hyperglycaemia and hyperlactataemia, whereas undernutrition predisposed for hypercholesterolaemia upon exposure to an obesogenic diet. Prenatal overnutrition (not undernutrition) interfered with pancreatic insulin secretion by non‐glucose‐dependent mechanisms.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Late gestation under‐ and overnutrition have differential impacts when combined with a post‐natal obesogenic diet on glucose–lactate–insulin adaptations during metabolic challenges in adolescent sheep","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prabhat Khanal","Sanne Vinter Husted","Anne Marie Dixen Axel","Lærke Johnsen","K.

In jejunum, HIGH lambs had an increased expression of Lactate gene and amplified when exposed to HCHF postnatally. Specifically, in LOW, sensitivity to HCHF was affected  in  ileum.  Thus,  the  mismatching  LOW-HCHF  nutrition  increased  expres-sions of angiogenic genes (VEGF, VEGF-R1, ANGPT1, RTK) and increased mucosa layer (tunica mucosa) thickness but reduced muscle layer (Tunica muscularis) thick-ness.  The  SI  is  a  target  of  prenatal  nutritional  programming,  where  late  gestation  overnutrition increased and shifted digestive capacity for carbohydrates toward the jejunum, whereas late gestation undernutrition predisposed for ileal angiogenesis and carbohydrate and fat hyperabsorptive capacity upon subsequent exposure to postna-tal obesogenic diet.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Late gestation over‐ and undernutrition predispose for visceral adiposity in response to a post‐natal obesogenic diet, but with differential impacts on glucose–insulin adaptations during fasting in lambs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.N.

Wheat of two cultivars, harvested at the flowering or the milk stage of maturity were ensiled in mini-silos, either directly after cutting (DC) or after wilting (W). After 2–7 months of storage, silages were subjected to a 7-day aerobic stability test during which changes in chemical composition, dry matter (DM) and neutral detergent fiber (aNDF) digestibility, and temperature, as well as DM losses and CO2 pro- duction, were measured. Silages from wheat cultivar BH were relatively dry (DM between 287 and 430 g/kg) and were mostly stable upon aerobic exposure. The flowering wheat of cultivar Galil was moister (DM of 199 g/kg), and the DC silages were stable upon aerobic exposure. Silages of the wilted flowering wheat (DM of 370 g/kg) spoiled and after 4 and 7 days, produced 15 and 76 g/kg DM CO2 , respectively. Silages from the milk stage of this cultivar, both DC and W were unstable, and a homofermentative LAB enhanced aerobic spoilage. Factorial analysis of variance was applied to the results with cultivar, stage of maturity, wilting and inoculant as main effects, as well as their interactions. Cultivar and LAB inoculant had effects on silage composition and aerobic stability, with stage of maturity having an effect on aerobic losses, whereas wilting did not have effects on aerobic spoilage indicators. The inoculant enhanced CO2 production in the silages prepared from the DC wheat of the flowering and milk stages, as compared with the respective non-inoculated control silages which contained high concentrations of VFA.
